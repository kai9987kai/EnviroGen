Sure, here's a basic example of how you might document the usage of the module:

# EnviroGen Python Package Documentation

## Overview

EnviroGen is a Python package for creating simple 2D environments with bots, obstacles, and plants. Bots can move around the environment, interact with obstacles and plants, and have health attributes. Obstacles have a size attribute and plants have an energy attribute and can grow.

## Installation

To install the EnviroGen package, use pip:

```
pip install envirogen
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the EnviroGen package:

```python
from envirogen import Environment, Bot, Obstacle, Plant

# Create an environment
env = Environment()

# Create a bot and add it to the environment
bot = Bot(x=0, y=0)
env.add_bot(bot)

# Create an obstacle and add it to the environment
obstacle = Obstacle(x=10, y=10, size=5)
env.add_obstacle(obstacle)

# Create a plant and add it to the environment
plant = Plant(x=-10, y=-10)
env.add_plant(plant)

# Move the bot
bot.move(dx=1, dy=1)

# Grow the plant
plant.grow()

# Print the bot's health
print(bot.health)
```

In this example, we first import the necessary classes from the EnviroGen package. We then create an environment, a bot, an obstacle, and a plant, and add them to the environment. We move the bot and grow the plant, and finally print the bot's health.

## Classes

### Environment

The `Environment` class represents the environment in which the bots, obstacles, and plants exist. It has methods for adding bots, obstacles, and plants to the environment.

### Bot

The `Bot` class represents a bot. It has an `x` and `y` attribute representing its position in the environment, a `health` attribute, a `move` method for changing its position, and a `take_damage` method for reducing its health.

### Obstacle

The `Obstacle` class represents an obstacle. It has an `x` and `y` attribute representing its position in the environment, and a `size` attribute.

### Plant

The `Plant` class represents a plant. It has an `x` and `y` attribute representing its position in the environment, an `energy` attribute, and a `grow` method for increasing its energy.

Please note that this is a very basic package and you may need to add more functionality to meet your specific needs.
